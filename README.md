PROJECTS
It’s time to build fluency in JavaScript fundamentals. In this next Pro Project, we’re going to practice functions in JavaScript so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? Functions help us build separation of concerns so our code isn’t one long function. What’s next? Calculators, sleep awareness, more JavaScript. You got this!
